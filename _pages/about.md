- **B.Eng.** in Aircraft Design and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (2018.9 – 2022.6), Outstanding Graduate

### 🛠 **Skills & Interests**

- **Programming:** Python, C++, MATLAB
- **Machine Learning:** PyTorch, PINNs, AI for PDEs, scientific computing
- **Languages:** English (IELTS 7.0), Mandarin (Native)
- **Others:** LaTeX, numerical analysis, computational mechanics
- **Hobbies:** Fitness, swimming, basketball, piano, photography

### 📚 **Publications**

- *[AsPINN: Adaptive Symmetry-Recomposition Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2024.117405)*, CMAME, 2024 (JCR Q1 TOP)
