I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at the [School of Advanced Interdisciplinary Sciences](https://sais.ucas.ac.cn/index.php/zh/) , [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.edu.cn/). My major is Computer Science and Technology. My research interests focus on AI for Science, with a particular emphasis on the design of physics-informed neural network architectures.
