üëã Hi, I'm **Ziti Liu** ‚Äî a Ph.D. student (combined Master-Ph.D. program, currently in my 4th year) in **Computer Science and Technology** at the [School of Advanced Interdisciplinary Sciences](https://sais.ucas.ac.cn/index.php/zh/), [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.edu.cn/), co-advised by the Institute of Automation, the Institute of Mechanics and TsingHua University. My research focuses on **AI for Science**, including both traditional **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** and the application of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in neural network architecture design for scientific problems, especially for PDE solving.

### üéì  **Education**

- (2022.9 ‚Äì 2027.6) **Ph.D.** in Computer Science and Technology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Research direction: AI for Science
- (2018.9 ‚Äì 2022.6) **B.Eng.** in Aircraft Design and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Outstanding Graduate

### üõ† **Skills & Interests**

- **Programming:** Python, C++, MATLAB
- **Machine Learning:** PyTorch, PINNs, llama, AI for PDEs, scientific computing
- **Languages:** English (IELTS 7.0), Mandarin (Native)
- **Others:** LaTeX, numerical analysis, data structures, algorithms
- **Hobbies:** Fitness, swimming, basketball, piano, photography

### üßë‚Äçüíª **Projects**

- **Generative Physics Engine Scenario Agent** (Ongoing)

  - **Project:** Integrates generative language models to address accuracy issues in physical data inversion with traditional large models.
  - **Work:** Developed a physics-agent framework based on LLM-SR, significantly reducing the time required by traditional symbolic regression methods. Embedded a reasoning evaluator to enhance LLM's answer filtering and correct reasoning abilities, improving inference accuracy and stability in physical scenarios.
- **Structured Physics-Informed Neural Networks via Knowledge Distillation**

  - **Project:** Utilized knowledge distillation algorithms to embed physical features into neural network structures, addressing interpretability and applicability challenges.
  - **Work & Results:** Built a PyTorch-based experimental platform, overcoming manual model construction and strong prior dependency. Developed the gray-box model œà-NN with higher accuracy, stability, and interpretability (algorithm performance improved by ~90%), reducing computational resource consumption to 7% of the original, suitable for low-power sensor group algorithms.
- **Adaptive Symmetry-Recomposition Physics-Informed Neural Networks**

  - **Project:** Leveraged Lie symmetry properties of PDEs to enhance neural network robustness and accuracy under sparse sampling.
  - **Work & Results:** Established a PyTorch-based platform, demonstrating high efficiency and accuracy in handling symmetric PDEs and ill-posed sampling. Enhanced PINNs for sparse sensor arrays (sampling density reduced by 50%) and high-precision computation on low-power devices (accuracy improved by 90%).
